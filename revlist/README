Question: Two singly linked lists of the same size contain numbers in decimals, where the head of the list contains the biggest number, (if 2->5->6, head contains 2, representing 200), and the tail contains the smallest (6).  Find the sum of the two lists, and represent that sum in its own linked list, implementing a method to reverse a linked list.
